        <h2>I'm Peter Philavanh</h2>
          <h3 class="background">Background</h3>
            <p>A little background about myself, I was born in Thailand and came to the states when I was just a baby. My family landed here in Portland and have been here ever since. I would consider myself a Portland native.I grew up in the Beaverton area during the upcoming era of 56K dialup internet and have seen the growth and development of all things related to the internet. I went to college at <span class="school">Portland State</span> and hold a <em>Bachelor's degree in Biology.</em>  I currently am employed at Oregon Health Science University in the Nuerosciences Med surge unit. I was hired in 2020 right before the pandemic. Working through the pandemic made me realize that healthcare was not something I wanted to continue pursueing a career in.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Leading to my choice to enroll into the coding bootcamp at Epicodus. I chose to do so because I believe the tech industry is here to stay and has had steady growth with continuation of growth many years into the future. I am a very curious person with how things work, whether it be car motors, bikes, software, or webpages. I like knowing how things function. Learning how to program has fullfilled my curiousity and at the same time challenging me.</p>
          <h3 class="interests">Current Interests and Hobbies</h3>
            <p>I am that person who has too many hobbies and interests for the amount of available time I currently have. Some major current interests are DJing or mixing, cooking, woodworking, fishing, hiking, overlanding (offroading with a destination), building and modifying cars. During the winter I am an avid snowboarder aswell. There are  too many things that always pique my interest and I tend to dabble into it for a while.</p>
